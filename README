cyg-emacsclient is a wrapper for emacsclient in cygwin environment. It
convert arguments into the posix form and passes them to the real
emacsclient. By making a symbolic link to the binary in your SendTo
directory, you can send files to cygwin emacs from Windows Explorer.

Note: The resource.ico was converted from gnu.xpm originally bundled
with emacs.
